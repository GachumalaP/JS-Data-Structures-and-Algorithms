# JS-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

Hello fellow developers

This repository is a collection of algorithms and data structures implemented using JavaScript. Isn't it intresting? 

We know that JS will not provide a seperate data structures for implementing/solving some problems (such as Priority Queue), Although we can acheive this using array but it's a bit complicated to create and use it. But I feel like by using JavaScript to solve such problems becomes more interesting because we will be able to understand the underlying concepts first.

I will also be implementing popular Algorithms

## Searching Algorithms
- Linear Search
* Binary Search

## Sorting Algorithms 
| Simple Algorithms  | Efficient Algorithms |
| -------------------| ---------------------|
| Insertion sort     | Merge sort           |
| Selection sort     | Quick sort           |
| Bubble sort        | Heap sort            |
