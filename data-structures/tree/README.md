Tree is a data structure

Types of trees

Binary 
N-nary tree

Binary tree


As the name suggests every node will have atmost 2 child nodes (which is it can have 0 , 1 or 2 nodes)

## levels of tree (not including root node(counted as 0))
## leaf node 
## Root node
## height is maximum depth of the Node (including the root node)
## depth of the tree
## degree of node(total number of branches of that node)


Complete binary tree
-> insertion of new node always start from left

Structure of binary tree
node holds the data and address of left and right node 

## Different forms of traversal
pre order traversal
post order traversal
Inorder traversal
level order traversal

## pre-order traversal(root at the beginning)
root > left > right

## post order traversal(root at the end)
left > right > root

## Inorder traversal(root in the middle)
left > root > right

## level order traversal
traverse via levels 

## forest 
forest is the combination of different trees
